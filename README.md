# Project
- A site that can connect to a USB MIDI device.
- The goal is to expand this into a synthesizer to use with any MIDI device.

## Current Functionality
- The site utilizes the Web MIDI API to connect to a MIDI device that is plugged into a USB port of a PC. A user can open the developer console in the browser to view data generated by various MIDI inputs from the device. These inputs could include pushing a key on a keyboard, hitting a touchpad, turning a knob or wheel, etc. 

## Compatible Browsers
- Chrome
- Opera
- Edge

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd midi`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run build`
5. `npm run start`
